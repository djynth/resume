## Dominic Zirbel's Resume

A complete and up-to-date resume designed to present a showcase of my experience, skills, and expertise. This resume is built with HTML and CSS, compiled into a standalone HTML file (resume.html) that is ideal for digital viewing, a PDF file (resume.pdf) designed to be printable, and an embeddable HTML file (embed.html) used to incorporate this resume into other websites. This resume is designed to be more accessible and intuitive, but in particular it is _not_ intended to be a "virtual tour of my work" or an "interactive experience"; it fulfills the same purpose as a traditional resume.
