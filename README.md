## [Dominic Zirbel's Resume](http://djynth.github.io/resume)

A complete resume designed to present a showcase of my experience and skills. This resume is built with HTML and CSS, compiled into a standalone HTML file (`resume.html`) that is ideal for digital viewing, a PDF file (`resume.pdf`) designed to be printable, and an embeddable HTML file (`embed.html`) used to incorporate the resume into other websites. The `index.html` file is a duplicate of `resume.html` to simplify hosting on GitHub Pages. I designed this resume to fulfill the same purpose as a traditional resume; in particular it is _not_ intended to be a "virtual tour" or an "interactive experience".
