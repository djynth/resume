## Dominic Zirbel's Resume ([View as HTML](http://djynth.github.io/resume/resume.html) | [Download PDF](http://djynth.github.io/resume/resume.pdf))

A complete resume designed to present a showcase of my experience and skills. This resume is built with HTML and CSS, compiled into a standalone HTML file (`resume.html`) that is ideal for digital viewing, a PDF file (`resume.pdf`) designed to be printable, and an embeddable HTML file (`embed.html`) used to include the resume in other pages. The `index.html` file is a duplicate of `resume.html` to simplify hosting on GitHub Pages. I designed this resume to fulfill the same purpose as a traditional resume; in particular, and despite its form, it is _not_ a "virtual tour" or "interactive experience".

To compile the resume from the source, run `src/compile.sh`. Requires [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [Less](http://lesscss.org/), [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/), and [less-plugin-clean-css](https://github.com/less/less-plugin-clean-css).
